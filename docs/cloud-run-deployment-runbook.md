# Cloud Run Deployment Runbook (Read-Only Recovery)

Recovered 2026-09-11 via the Cloud Run Admin API using existing Application Default Credentials in this workspace. No deploy, traffic change, or configuration change was made while recovering this information.

## Identity

- **GCP Project:** `gen-lang-client-0801664258`
- **Service name:** `shiekh-location-company-directory`
- **Region:** `us-west1`
- **Default Cloud Run URL:** `https://shiekh-location-company-directory-vwqb4tnhoq-uw.a.run.app`
- **Branded domain:** `https://shiekh-dir.ai.studio` → Cloud Run domain mapping routes to `shiekh-location-company-directory` (us-west1). Confirmed live via `gcloud beta run domain-mappings list`.
- **Artifact Registry image:** `us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/gen-lang-client-0801664258/cloud-run-source-deploy/shiekh-location-company-directory`

## Current live revision

- `latestReadyRevisionName`: `shiekh-location-company-directory-phasec9a91bcf`
- Traffic: 100% to that revision, tag `phasec` (revision suffix appears to encode commit `9a91bcf` on `main`)
- Autoscaling: `minScale=0`, `maxScale=20`, `cpu-throttling=true`, `startup-cpu-boost=true`

Many older tagged, no-traffic revisions exist for rollback/reference (`smtp`, `cfg`, `tpl`, `onboarding`, `msg`, `fbmail`, `rev-9ce8646`, `a14`, `a14b`, `smtp2`, `custom-fields`, plus the untagged canary-era revisions), each reachable at `https://<tag>---shiekh-location-company-directory-vwqb4tnhoq-uw.a.run.app`.

## Runtime environment (names only; no secret values other than public Firebase config)

- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=gen-lang-client-0801664258`
- `FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID=ai-studio-shiekhlocationco-00e1a479-af25-4ab6-9565-5c8b804c56a4`
- `DIRECTORY_APP_URL=https://shiekh-dir.ai.studio`
- `FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY` — public Firebase web config (same class of value as `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` in `.env.example`)
- `SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com`, `SMTP_PORT=587`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`, `SMTP_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS`, `DIRECTORY_STEWARD_EMAIL` — all `theo@shiekhshoes.org`
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` — sourced from Secret Manager secret `Shiekh_Location`, version `latest` (value not read)

## Deployment command (recovered pattern)

No Dockerfile, `cloudbuild.yaml`, or CI workflow exists in this repository. The image is built by Cloud Run's source deploy (Buildpacks), which runs this repo's `npm run build` then `npm start` (see `package.json`). The recovered/expected command is:

```bash
gcloud run deploy shiekh-location-company-directory \
  --source . \
  --project gen-lang-client-0801664258 \
  --region us-west1 \
  [--revision-suffix <label>] [--tag <tag>] [--no-traffic]
```

Promote a tagged/no-traffic revision to production traffic with:

```bash
gcloud run services update-traffic shiekh-location-company-directory \
  --project gen-lang-client-0801664258 \
  --region us-west1 \
  --to-revisions <revision-name>=100
```

## Adjacent services — do not confuse with production

- `shiekh-directory-auth-canary` (us-west1) — separate canary testbed service, not mapped to `shiekh-dir.ai.studio`.
- `remix-shiekh-location-company-directory2` (us-west1) — mapped to `shk-dir.ai.studio` (a different domain), not the production `shiekh-dir.ai.studio` target.
- `shiekh-casting-v6-1-firebase` (us-west1) — mapped to `shiekh.ai.studio`, unrelated app.
- All `us-central1` services in this project belong to an unrelated loyalty/cards application, not this directory app.

## Known access gap

The exact historical `gcloud run deploy` invocations (precise flags, revision-suffix/tag conventions actually used per release) are not stored anywhere in this repository — there is no Dockerfile, `cloudbuild.yaml`, or GitHub Actions workflow. They exist only in the operator's prior shell history or Cloud Console/Cloud Audit Logs, which were not queried here. This runbook's deployment command is reconstructed from the live service's build metadata (Artifact Registry path, revision-suffix pattern, `package.json` scripts), not read directly from a stored command.
